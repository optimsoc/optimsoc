# OpTiMSoC: Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip

OpTiMSoC is an [award-winning](https://www.optimsoc.org/blog/2019/06/16/award.html)
an open-source framework primarily written in Verilog which allows you to 
build your own manycore System-on-Chip by connecting tiles like processors 
and memories through a Network-on-Chip. The resulting system can then be 
simulated on a PC or synthesized for an FPGA. You want to know how a SoC really
works by taking a deep look inside? You want to evaluate the benefit of a new 
hardware accelerator? You want to test algorithms to assign tasks efficiently 
to different processing cores? OpTiMSoC gets you started!

## Getting started

OpTiMSoC comes with an ever growing documentation as well as a lot of sample 
code that you can use to get started quickly. Depending on the hardware and 
software you have available, you can start by running a small existing system 
on an FPGA or simulating it (with Verilator or ModelSim).

## A sneak peek

OpTiMSoC can boot Linux! Have a look, and [read more about it in our blog](https://www.optimsoc.org/blog/2018/12/19/linux.html).
