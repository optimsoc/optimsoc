// Description :
//
// Synchronous LIFO stack using BRAM.
//
// This is trickier than you might think. The problem is that if you
// do a read and a write to a RAM, you need to use the same address
// otherwise you incurr another port. The idea is to keep a
// top-of-stack register to hold the top of the stack. If you push but
// don't pop, then you write the top-of-stack and accept the new value
// onto the top-of-stack. If you pop then you read from the BRAM into
// the top-of-stack.  If you push and pop then you just swap with the
// top-of-stack and don't do any BRAM operation.
//
// A further wrinkle is that you can't have a read enable on the read
// from the BRAM. So you need to always read from the BRAM but not
// always use the result.  I use a read MUX to select which to
// actually use for the top-of-stack - the top-of-stack register or
// the memory read.
